MPB SYSTEM – CUE–PHASE ALIGNMENT PROTOCOL

Purpose:
Ensure that every cue used in practice planning aligns with the decision tempo and cognitive load of its corresponding phase (Refine, Adapt, Challenge, Compete).

STRUCTURE:

1. REFINE PHASE
- Tempo: Slowed, self-directed
- Decision Timing: Open-ended
- Cue Type: Technical, internal, emotional reset
- Acceptable Cues:
  - “Land, pause, launch.”
  - “Feel your base before the shot.”
  - “Cue your breath before moving.”
  - “Hold your shape after contact.”

2. ADAPT PHASE
- Tempo: Controlled but dynamic
- Decision Timing: 0.5s–1s reads
- Cue Type: Perceptual + bodily integration
- Acceptable Cues:
  - “See while you move.”
  - “Land into your read.”
  - “Catch it ready.”
  - “Play with vision before touch.”

3. CHALLENGE PHASE
- Tempo: Unpredictable, randomized
- Decision Timing: 0–0.5s reads
- Cue Type: Externalized + fast pattern recognition
- Acceptable Cues:
  - “Decide before you land.”
  - “Don’t wait—respond.”
  - “Play off the cue, not the catch.”

4. COMPETE PHASE
- Tempo: Full-speed chaos
- Decision Timing: Continuous flow
- Cue Type: Constraint enforcement + behavior correction
- Acceptable Cues:
  - “You’re outside constraint—reset.”
  - “Find the domino.”
  - “Did that trigger an advantage?”

NOTES:
• Cues can be embedded into drills ONLY if phase-aligned.
• “Pause before you act” is illegal in Challenge and Compete phases.
• If the cue is emotional (breathing, reset), ensure it doesn’t break decision continuity.
