MPB SYSTEM – ETHICAL GUARDRAILS

Core Principle: System builds freedom, not compliance.

Structural Enforcements:
1. All PDP changes must show Source UID
2. Manual overrides log reasoning
3. Level comparisons hidden in shared views
4. All player reflections must be linked to real sessions
5. Player data export available on request
6. Session summaries flagged if reflection gaps exceed 2
7. Override frequency tracked per coach

Visible Cues:
- “You are more than your level.”
- “This prompt is based on how you showed up today.”
- “Your growth is defined by friction, not perfection.”

Coach Agreement Excerpt:
- “I will not use system levels to restrict access.”
- “I will engage player reflections seriously and regularly.”
- “I understand automation augments coaching, not replaces it.”

Goal: Ethics embedded in workflow, not policies.
