## 🎯 Narrative Purpose (Macro-Level)
> A systems indictment disguised as memoir.

- Expose the emotional and developmental cost of modern youth sports  
- Reimagine coaching as liberation, not control  
- Bridge personal experience, loss, and transformation into a coherent philosophy and movement  
- Offer a living blueprint for how sport can become a vehicle for breath, autonomy, and becoming  

_Not a technical manual. A philosophical documentary in prose._  
_Every chapter is a short film. Every lyric is thesis. The personal becomes the political._
