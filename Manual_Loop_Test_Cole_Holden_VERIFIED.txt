SESSION SNAPSHOT
-----------------
Recent Dates: April 15, 2025, April 17, 2025
Session Tags:
- Constraint Execution (Fight for Feet drill-layered across both sessions)
- Emotional Load & Recovery (evidenced through visible frustration loop and self-regulation breakdowns)
- Rhythm and Balance Degradation under Pressure (collapse of base, rushed shot timing)
- Contact Aversion Patterns (avoidance or bracing during pressure finish sequences)

Coach Cues Used:
- “Reset base before launch”
- “Land, breathe, then shoot”
- “Be decisive with space, but anchored in your feet”

Behavioral Patterns Observed:
- Shot pacing breaks down after first miss
- Balance collapses when decision speed increases
- Emotional response leads to performance drop instead of recovery

REFLECTION PROMPTS (TIED TO TAG STRUCTURE)
-------------------------------------------
- What helped you find your base today, even when you felt rushed?
- What did you feel in your body after your first miss?
- When did you land strong before acting?
- Did contact help or hurt your shot rhythm today?
- How can you breathe into your base before going next time?

PLAYER RESPONSES (SIMULATED)
-----------------------------
- I felt like I rushed when I got the ball and forgot to land first.
- After I missed the first one, I just wanted to fix it fast.
- I stayed balanced when I paused before my shot in the corner.
- When I bumped a little first, I felt more ready.
- Breathing before I moved made me feel calmer, but I forgot it when I got tired.
