MPB SYSTEM – CUE + DRILL LOGIC VALIDATOR CHECKLIST

This checklist must be applied to each drill block before it is approved for practice.

1. PHASE VALIDATION
☐ What is the intended Flow Phase of this block? (Refine / Adapt / Challenge / Compete)
☐ Does the drill's timing and intensity match that phase?
☐ Is the player decision tempo in sync with phase demands?

2. CUE VALIDATION
☐ Are the cues in this drill phase-legal?
☐ Is any cue imported from a slower scaffold (e.g. Refine) into a higher-speed block?
☐ Do cues support perception-action continuity, or interrupt it?

3. CONSTRAINT LOGIC
☐ Is the constraint matched to the correct game-phase intent?
☐ Does it amplify—not limit—the decision window?
☐ Is the constraint externally observable (not just internal or emotional)?

4. PLAYER FIT
☐ Is this block tagged to players whose constraints align with its tempo?
☐ Will this cue increase clarity, or introduce friction?
☐ Does it encourage transfer, not just repetition?

5. ADAPTABILITY CHECK
☐ Is there a reset layer if the constraint fails? (Flip, freeze, feedback)
☐ Can the drill be modified in-session without breaking its logic?

If any answer is “no” → redesign or relocate the cue or constraint.
