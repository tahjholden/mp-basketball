# Human OS Architecture & NoBlackBox Trust Framework

## 1. Executive Summary & Origin Story

The Human OS is a modular, user-first, ethical operating system for human development and high-performance environments. It began as a project to solve the broken youth basketball experience, but the system logic is now applicable to wellness, fitness, therapy, behavior, education, and business.  
At its core, the OS gives individuals granular control over their data, privacy, permissions, and experience, with AI and automation as opt-in accelerators rather than required components.

## 2. Modular OS Architecture & NoBlackBox Ethics Layer

All core data flows are structured to enable plug-and-play verticals (Basketball OS, Wellness OS, Therapy OS, Behavior OS, etc.)—each using a shared foundation.  
The NoBlackBox layer means every data action (view, share, edit, AI decision) is logged, auditable, explainable, and always permissioned by the user.  
Data never leaves the user’s control: sharing is purpose-based, time-based, and revocable at any moment.

---

## 3. Granular, Purpose-Based Permissions

Users grant access at the field or module level, for specific purposes (e.g., a coach can see PDP tags, but not wellness notes; a restaurant can see birthday/favorite dish for perks).  
Every access is permissioned and logged. Users can revoke access at any time and view a dashboard showing who has what data, why, and for how long.

## 4. AI/Manual Workflow Toggle & CRAFT Prompt Framework

The system works fully manually, with dropdowns, checklists, and drag-and-drop planning, or AI can be toggled on for “push” suggestions, auto-generation, and conversational workflows.  
All AI workflows are built using the CRAFT prompt engineering framework: Context, Role, Action, Format, Target Audience.  
Prompts encode logic, permissions, explainability, and output formats—making the OS’s agentic behaviors both proprietary and user-friendly.

---

## 5. Audit, Compliance, and Explainability Design

Every action—manual or AI—is logged to an audit trail, including what was accessed, by whom, and why.  
AI outputs always include an “explanation” field. Users can click “Why did this happen?” to see the reason for any automation or recommendation.  
All systems are designed to be HIPAA/GDPR/FERPA/COPPA-ready from day one.

## 6. Pricing Matrix

**Individuals:**  
- Free (basic manual use)  
- $7–$15/mo (Pro: unlimited history/analytics, AI suggestions, advanced permissions)  
- $20–$35/mo (Power: AI agent, full audit log, advanced sharing)  

**Organizations:**  
- $99/mo (Starter)  
- $499/mo (Growth)  
- $1,500–$5,000+/mo (Enterprise)  
- Add-ons and API integration are charged per usage or flat fee.  
All pricing emphasizes transparency and user control—businesses pay only for permissioned access, users always see what’s shared.

---

## 7. Real-World User/Org Flows

- **Youth Basketball:** Coach logs attendance, sees PDP tags, assigns drills (manual or AI-assisted). Players/parents control what is shared with coaches and teams.
- **Therapy:** Clients track mental health, share only what they want with providers. Every access and recommendation is logged.
- **Business:** Restaurant gets user’s birthday/favorite dish for personalized offers—only if the user grants it; can be revoked anytime.

---

## 8. API Integration & Dynamic Packaging

The OS offers robust API integration: users connect outside apps/services (Netflix, Apple Music, health apps) and decide what to share and for what purpose.  
API integrations are bundled in pricing tiers, never microcharged per integration. B2B partners can sponsor integrations, reducing user cost.  
All API accesses are auditable, revocable, and surfaced in the user's dashboard.

---

## 9. Business Model (Dual-Sided)

**B2C:** Individuals subscribe for enhanced functionality, privacy, and AI features.  
**B2B:** Teams, organizations, clinics, and businesses pay for access to permissioned user data, analytics, dashboards, and workflow integration.  
Ethics and user control are selling points for both user and business.

## 10. Developer Checklist & Best Practices

- All tables include permissioning, created_by, audit, and explanation fields.
- UI always exposes data sharing, audit logs, and explanations.
- Modularize all verticals and features to inherit core permission/audit logic.
- Every AI workflow uses the CRAFT prompt structure for reliability and explainability.
- Notification engine for permission changes, access, and AI events.
- Ship privacy-on by default; all sharing is opt-in.

---

## 11. Codex Prompt Engineering Guide

Every new agent, workflow, or module uses a CRAFT-based prompt, specifying: context, expert role, numbered actions, output format, and intended audience.  
All prompts require inclusion of permission and audit logic.  
Codex prompts are version-controlled and treated as core IP.

## 12. Sample Prompts, Schemas & Roadmap

- Sample CRAFT prompts for practice planning, wellness intake, parent dashboard.
- Example schema for audit_log, permissions, and module inheritance.
- Pricing matrix table and API bundle samples.
- Roadmap for expanding verticals and maintaining NoBlackBox by default.

## 13. Prompt Security & Obfuscation (Modular CRAFT Pattern)

To safeguard proprietary prompt logic and maintain system integrity:

- All core prompts and CRAFT frameworks must be stored server-side and never exposed to client-facing code or UI.
- Prompt fragments should be dynamically assembled on the server and provided only as ephemeral, minimal payloads to the LLM API.
- UI components should send only user input and intent, not the prompt templates themselves.
- Admin access to raw prompts must be permissioned, logged, and require MFA.
- All prompt edits and executions must be versioned and auditable.
- Watermarking and legal protection are recommended for enterprise deployments.
- **Modular CRAFT architecture enhances security by fragmenting the prompt.** Each section (Context, Role, Action, Format, Target Audience) is stored and handled separately; only the final assembled prompt is exposed to the LLM, minimizing risk of reverse engineering or leakage.
