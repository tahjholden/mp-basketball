MPB SYSTEM â€“ DATABASE ARCHITECTURE FINALIZATION

Core Principles:
- UID-first design (hidden if necessary, always present for traceability)
- Source UID field for any derived entry (e.g., PDP, DevNote, Session, Reflection)
- All relational fields should be explicit and type-consistent (Linked Record, Single Select, etc.)

Tables to Confirm:
1. Player Profile
2. Coach Profile
3. PDP Tracker
4. Development Notes
5. Practice Plan Log
6. Drill/Environment Library
7. Tag + Constraint Bank
8. Attendance Log
9. Raw Communication Log
10. Session Drill Link
11. Reflection Tracker (Player and Coach)

Each table must include:
- UID (first column)
- Human-readable Display Name (second column)
- Source UID (if not a base entity)
- Field types clearly labeled
- Placeholder values (`TBD_LINK_<TABLE>`) for unlinked records

Deliverable: Ensure each of the 11 tables meets this schema before automation proceeds.
