MPB SYSTEM – MANUAL LOOP TEST

Purpose: Validate full system logic from input → adaptation → feedback.

Sample Player:
- Name: Cole Holden
- PDP Focus: Pressure Read
- Friction Tag: Avoids Paint Under Pressure
- Level: 3
- Age: 10

Session:
- Coach Cue: “Be decisive with space”
- Drill: 2v1 decision constraint
- Coach Observation: “Cole passed early every time—avoiding contact”

Manual Flow:
1. Reflection Prompt:
   - “What made it hard to hold your dribble near the rim today?”
   - “Describe a moment you made a fast decision—what helped?”
   - “What did you see before the defender stepped up?”

2. Player Reflection:
   - “I didn’t want to get blocked.”
   - “It was easier when I knew the help was late.”

3. PDP Adjustment:
   - Add Tag: “Pre-contact hesitation”
   - New Constraint: Add finish-through-contact cue

4. Next Practice Drill:
   - Constraint: Must finish after bump on first touch
   - Cue: “Feel first, decide second”

Goal: Create one full loop to hand off to automation team as standard.
