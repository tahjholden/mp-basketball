## 🎵 Title & Lyric
**Chapter 2: I Used to Love H.E.R.**  
“I met this girl when I was ten years old / And what I loved most, she had so much soul.” — Common

## 🎯 Narrative Purpose

This is the heartbreak.  
Where Chapter 1 revealed a rupture, Chapter 2 shows the slow unraveling that came before it—the loss that happened in stages, so quietly you barely noticed until it was gone.

A eulogy for a love that used to feel like freedom. You fell in love with basketball before you understood systems, pressure, and performance. The driveway games, the pickup battles, the imagined buzzer-beaters—that was her. That was soul.

But slowly, love was replaced with labor. The joy turned into judgment. You weren’t abandoned by the game. She just stopped looking like herself.

This chapter isn’t angry—it’s aching. It’s the soft sadness of seeing a love story shift into a job description. And it plants the emotional foundation for everything you’re trying to reclaim.

## 🔑 Core Story Beats & Scene Framing

### 1. The First Love
- Ten years old in the driveway. No rules. Just belief.
🎬 Golden-hour driveway. Kid echoing Marv Albert. Freeze frame jumper.

### 2. The Seduction of Structure
- First AAU gear, drills, uniforms. Feels professional. Soul fades.
🎬 Quick cuts: drills, CEOs-in-sneakers vibes. Joy dims.

### 3. The First Wound
- Freshman benching without explanation. Confusion. Shame.
🎬 Wide shot. Everyone moves but you. One long, unbearable cut.

### 4. The Breakdown in the Hotel
- Post-tournament breakdown. You cry in a bathroom.
🎬 Flickering light. Mirror. Stillness. Quiet breakdown.

### 5. The Ride Home
- Dad asks: “Still having fun?” Pause. Silence answers.
🎬 Blurred highway. Silent pause. Father's grip tightens.

### 6. Watching Cole Go Through It
- You’re now the dad. Cole’s look = your past.
🎬 Overlay: past-you benched, present-Cole fidgeting. Time folds.

## 💥 Emotional Progression

Wonder → Joy → Subtle Discomfort → Disillusionment → Grief → Recognition → Resolve

> A slow fade, not a sharp break. Each memory deepens the ache.

## 📚 Philosophical & Thematic Spine
- The game didn’t betray us—it evolved without us.
- Love isn’t just about passion—it’s about protection.
- Kids don’t fall out of love with basketball. They get pushed out.
- Structure without soul is just control.
- You can’t fix what you won’t mourn.

🪞 **Systemic Mirror Prompt:**  
What happened to you wasn’t just personal. It’s a design flaw. When joy becomes secondary to exposure, the system succeeds—and the soul dies. Every silent benching, every tear behind closed doors, is cultural evidence.

## 📌 Must-Include Anchors

- “I met her in the driveway. No scoreboard. No audience. Just me and her.”  
- “She didn’t change all at once. She just stopped looking like herself.”  
- “I didn’t fall out of love. I was coached out of it.”  
- “That night in the hotel, I cried for the first time. But not because we lost—because I did.”  
- “My dad asked if I was still having fun. I paused. That pause said everything.”  
- “Years later, Cole wore the same look. And I hated that I recognized it.”  
- “I used to love her. I still do. I just don’t recognize who she became.”

## 🧩 Role in the Book Arc

This is the heartbreak before the healing.  
It establishes the emotional cost of what was lost and positions you—not just as a coach or parent—but as a witness to something sacred being stripped away.

> Chapter 1 = awakening.  
> Chapter 2 = what you lost while asleep.
