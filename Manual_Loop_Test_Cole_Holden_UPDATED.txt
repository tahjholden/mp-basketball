- Next time pressure builds, what do you want to feel in your body first?

PLAYER RESPONSES (SIMULATED)
-----------------------------
- I felt myself rushing and kind of falling forward too much.
- After I missed, I got frustrated and wanted to fix it too fast.
- I stayed grounded one time when I caught it and paused before I shot.
- Breathing helped once, but I forgot it later when I felt rushed.
- I want to feel my feet strong and then breathe before I go next time.
